  			<td><p>Kiwi Magazine is a biannual print publication, covering everything from art, culture, lifestyle, politics, and whatever additional hubbub we find fancy. And how may this be different from every other Los Angeles production, you ask? Rather than merely focusing on documenting the span of new cold-pressed coffee shops opening up, or the hottest new hipster-synth-boy-bands, we add a little bit more spice. Our goal is not only to present coverage over Los Angeles’ arts and culture, but to produce art and culture. With our staff of eximious content creators, we seek to relay human experiences through short stories, photographs, illustrations, awkward advice columns, interviews, and a touch of flair. Our delivery is raw and pure, like fresh produce.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, Kiwi Magazine will be making some major changes for Winter 2017. We will be re-launching the club in its entirety, starting from scratch and rebuilding Kiwi anew as an artistic collective. In more specific terms, this re-launch means that Kiwi will still produce magazine issues biannually, but the focus will shift towards building a small community of autonomous creatives. Instead of minimal participation in the form of project proposals and final project presentations for the magazine, we will have meetings, field trips, group art projects, and more. The collective is about providing spaces and opportunities to connect, gain new perspectives, discuss ideas, and develop as artists. We want to share and grow in our experiences and our art, still as pure and fresh and Kiwi as ever.</p>
        <p>We’re looking for people with the creativity and initiative to actively participate in a collective such as this. If Kiwi collective seems like a good fit for you, we encourage you to apply!</p>
