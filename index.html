  			<td><p>Kiwi Magazine is a biannual print publication, covering everything from art, culture, lifestyle, politics, and whatever additional hubbub we find fancy. And how may this be different from every other Los Angeles production, you ask? Rather than merely focusing on documenting the span of new cold-pressed coffee shops opening up, or the hottest new hipster-synth-boy-bands, we add a little bit more spice. Our goal is not only to present coverage over Los Angeles’ arts and culture, but to produce art and culture. With our staff of eximious content creators, we seek to relay human experiences through short stories, photographs, illustrations, awkward advice columns, interviews, and a touch of flair. Our delivery is raw and pure, like fresh produce.</p></td>

These members are the ones accountable for relaying human experiences. <span id="orange"> We're interested in Food, Culture + Politics, Personal Experience, Identity, Interview + Documentary, Popular Culture + Mass Media, Short Story + Written Art, Beauty, Lifestyle, Health + Fitness, Advice Column, and Fashion + Style.</span></p></td>
